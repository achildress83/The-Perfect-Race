    "The 100m sprint is arguable the purest display of raw athletic ability and there are many variables that impact the perfect race. Athletes train their whole lives to reach the highest level. We want to know how much of a factor father time (age) and mother nature (tailwind) are when it comes to running the perfect race. We plan to conduct 3 Hypothesis tests as outlined below:\n",

    "1. Tailwind. We seek to answer whether tailwind has a statistically significant effect on race times \n",
