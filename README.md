### Contributors: *Anesu Masube and Aaron Childress*

# Goals

The goal of this analysis is to gain a deeper understanding of variables that affect achieving the fastes speeds in sprint racing with a case study of over 3000 of the fastes times ever recorded in a 100m Men's races. We tested whether tail wind and age have an effect on achieving the fastes times.
